Create temp files for vectors: 

1) Vector from 1000 function word blocks of emails. [Averaged over 10 block iterations]
2) Vector from 2000 function word blocks of emails.[Averaged over 10 block iterations]
3) Vector from 5000 function word blocks of emails. [Averaged over 10 block iterations]

Same for 2-grams and 3-grams



Tech. grab all content from all emails of this user and write to a temp file here. 

Select a k word block. Create a vector for the top 50 function word. 
Select a k word block. Create a vector for the top 50 bi grams
Select a k word block. Create a vector for the top 50 tri grams

Repeat for 200 function words, bi grams and tri grams.
